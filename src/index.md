The year is 2000 

If you think that Limp Bizkit fans are a bunch of violent, misogynist bullies, you aren't alone. "For years I looked into the crowd and saw a bunch of bullies and assholes who tortured me and ruined my life," [Fred Durst told Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/fred-durst-limp-bizkit-was-used-as-fuel-to-torture-other-people-108646/) in 2009. "They were using my music as fuel to torture other people, even dressing like me. The music was being misinterpreted, and the irony affected me and we stepped away . . . I don't even listen to any type of music that's like Limp Bizkit at all. I love jazz music and sad music. I'm a sentimental guy. I'm a romantic guy." Well, if that's how the frontman of Limp Bizkit feels about Limp Bizkit, imagine how the rest of us feel. - https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/readers-poll-the-ten-worst-bands-of-the-nineties-13654/
