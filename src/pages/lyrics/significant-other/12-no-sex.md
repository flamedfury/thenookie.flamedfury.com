[Fred Durst:]
Went too fast, way too soon
I feel disgusted and you should too
It's no good when all that's left is the sex, the sex

[Fred Durst:]
Sex has become all I know about you
Memories of those filthy things that we do
There is not one single thought that is left after sex with you

[Fred Durst:]
Should've left my pants on this time
But instead you had to let me dive right in
Should've left my pants on this time
You let me dive right, you let me dive right in

[Fred Durst:]
Wait, it's my ass, and your perfume
They make temptation hard to refuse
So, I guess, we undressed to have sex, dirty sex

[Fred Durst:]
Sex has become all I know about you
Memories of those filthy things that we do
There is not one single thought that is left after sex with you

[Fred Durst:]
Should've left my pants on this time
But instead you had to let me dive right in
Should've left my pants on this time
You let me dive right, you let me dive right in

[Aaron Lewis and Fred Durst:]
How can you respect yourself?
You couldn't respect yourself but
And I didn't respect myself
And I couldn't infect myself with
Realize that I'm worth more than that
Realize that I'm worth more than that
Realize that I'm worth more than that
Realize that I mean more than that

[Fred Durst:]
Should've left my pants on this time
But instead you had to let me dive right in
Should've left my pants on this time
You let me dive right, you let me dive right in
