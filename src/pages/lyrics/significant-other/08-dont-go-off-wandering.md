<pre>
Everyday is nothing but stress to me
I'm constantly dwelling on how you got the best of me
Wanna know something I can't believe
The way you keep testing me and mentally molesting me
Would you think any less of me if I said that I'd be there?
Would you think any less of me if I said I really cared?
Of course you would 'cause you only want what you can't have
As for me I'm stuck with my dick in my hand because

You don't feel nothing at all
You don't feel nothing at all

Maybe there's more to life than it seems
I'm constantly running from reality chasing dreams
Wanna know something I can't believe
Just how much misery comes with humility
Do you think any less of me now that I'm gone?
Look at me now, everything is gone
I can't seem to do anything right
But I figured out why you don't let me inside because

You don't feel nothing at all
You don't feel nothing at all

You need nothing from me now
So you think I'm useless to you now
But I need one thing from you now
I insist that you feel me now!
You said, you said, you said you needed me
You said, you said, you said
You said you needed me
You said
You said
You said

You don't feel nothing at all
You don't feel nothing at all
