Shut up!

Go away!

I'm so sick of them deadlines
I understand why them maniacs are hitting them headlines
And even though I don't know ya
Through my lyrics I'll show ya, the sanity's over
People say I'm bugged out
See, while I'm in the field, you're in the dugout
My business â€“ stay the fuck out!
All I know is that the beat goes on and will be the same, 'til the day I'm gone

Nobody loves me, nobody cares!
Nobody loves me, nobody owes me a thing!
Nobody loves me, nobody cares!
Nobody loves me, maybe I'll go eat worms!

I'm so sick of the world now
It's all these people bag on my identity
Now I'm the enemy running out my mouth again
We'll settle up when you step into the South, my friend
You're the big one, you're the good one
I'm the bad one, that's so sad, son
'Cause I'm running nowhere
You see, there's black sheep everywhere
You need to drop that guard, man, it ain't that hard

Nobody loves me, nobody cares!
Nobody loves me, nobody owes me a thing!
Nobody loves me, nobody cares!
Nobody loves me, maybe I'll go eat worms!

Now what's the matter with this?
Someone's sure to find me
No exceptions for this
So many times I fall through
No one has ever warned me
Life seems so meaningless whenever it gets your inner strength
I'm such a piece of shit
So perfect!
Oh, you're so perfect!
Oh, you're so much better than me
So much better than me!
You suck!

Nobody loves me, nobody cares
Nobody loves me, maybe I'll go eat worms
