Clunk!
Clunk!
Clunk!
Clunk!
Clunk!
Clunk!
Clunk!

Hey mister, elevate that mind into a blessed stop
You might need to rest up or pump that chest up
Because that mental is faded, ego you overplayed it
You buster, you just can't be trusted
The drama, your mama must've really been disgusted
But you got no clue always screaming everybody owes you
Well kid I never did, and never will

It's gone too far, it's gone too far and it's on!
I never did, well I never did kid, it's gone too far!

Drunken punk's been bringing all the funk in
Knowing you man, you're probably not thinking
Got you lip-syncing, lyric goes flying
Over that head â€“ you'll be crying!
Lyin' in your death bed, now you're just a reject
You point your finger at MC'y D just to gain a little respect
But you've got no clue, always screaming everybody owes you
Well, kid I never did and never will

It's gone too far, well it's gone way too far punk!
I never did, it's gone too far!

You need to drop that freaking ego before you crash
Before the headlights are simply glaring in your eyes and you're going down
What's the matter with the life that you're leading?
When you're bleeding, everyone's thinking how much they hate you
It's not too late dude, just that time for you to zip up that grill
Take a deep breath and look around, there ain't nobody left you're just a target, bull's eye
And still you walk around like a clown in a force field
See I'm not crazy, you're the one who's crazy
Institution bound to be the only way that we can even solve this
Had about as much as I can take so do yourself a favor

You've built that for so long
(Won't you just do yourself a favor?)
And I just wanna get it out

Clunk!

There's certainly some distortion in there. (What?)
Certainly some distortion in there
I can't hear you, I've got distortion in my ear
A thought just came to me while watching you and the guys play that
Um, the distortion feels the sound. It's like anguish or frustration
Like trying to thread, a needle with... with... thread
And you keep trying. (Can you thread a nee... a needle with a piece of rope?)
And I wonder, I wonder if that's what happened when the kids were getting the guitars
They were trying so hard, they wanted to play like their favorite singer
They just couldn't bring it off, so they turned it up louder just to
Because even your face got red, and, and the expression on your face was that of, of sheer frustration, or anger, or just
What do you feel when you play this distortion on there?
Um, what I feel when I play distortion like that is, I'm venting my... anger
Letting it all out, ya' know. There's no reservations or politeness
I'm no longer trying to please anyone, I'm trying to please me. Trying to get myself off
That's a form of honesty, isn't it?
I suppose
