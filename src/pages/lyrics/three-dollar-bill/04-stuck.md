 Psycho female blowing up the phone line
You need to tighten that screw it's been loose for a long time
I've been slammed with some bad luck
Soon I'm gonna bring you doom with the buck, buck
And now you duck, duck, goose, I'm letting loose
With the 30-ought freestyle labeled hostile by my profile
Must be all the madness you and all your tactics
Jonesing for my cash got to make them pockets super fat
Hey I'm a humble man kicking out my jams like a tramp
I'm gonna stick it like a stamp to this business
What's with all the business?
I get paid to take the microphone and slay the stage
Stay away from all the bros in my band and all the fans
And all my friends when the cash is coming in
Or I'll be slamming them balls to the wall
With the ink on my flesh to the 'yes, yes y'all!'
No 9 to 5, I'll still survive
I keep my engine on that amp like a Chattanooga champ
That's all we need, another bad seed
Planted on this Earth motivated by greed

You wanna play that game bitch?
You take a dash for my cash it's your ass that I'm blasting!
Boy, you wanna play that game bitch?
You take a dash for my cash it's your ass that I'm blasting
You're bad luck, you're so... stuck!
Stuck, deep down in that hole again!
Stuck, got your brain on my green again!
Stuck, you're so, you're so, you're so stuck you don't even know!

All I wanted was a Pepsi, just one Pepsi
Far from suicidal still I get them tendencies
Bringing back them memories
That I really miss when I reminisce
Rocking back in the 80s live my attitude to do or die
Once I was a maggot but now I'm just Super Fly
Bound for the boundaries, no limit G
Fat ass rhythms driven by my destiny
Your style's in my pocket
Proclaimed to regain that essence
Pressin 'cause I'm hostile labeled by my profile
Indeed I am, I am indeed hostile when it comes to greed

You wanna play that game bitch?
You take a dash for my cash it's that ass that I'm blasting!
Boy, you wanna play that game bitch?
You take a dash for my cash it's your ass that I'm blasting
You're bad luck, you're so, stuck!
Stuck, deep down in that hole again!
Stuck, got your brain on my green again!
Stuck, you're so, you're so, you're so stuck you don't even know!

Aw yeah, ain't nothin' like a greedy bitch
Digging, digging, digging, digging, digging so deep for that green
All I know, all I know, that you must be fucked up in the head
I got a little problem, just one question, biatch
Why, why you wanna be like that?
Why, why you gotta be like that?
You wanna be like that?
Why, why you wanna be like that?
Why, why you wanna be like that?
Why, why you gotta be like that?
Why, why you wanna be like that?
Why the fuck you wanna be like that?
Why, why, why you gotta be like that?
Why the fuck you wanna be like that?
Why, why, why, why, why, why you gotta be?
Why, why, why, you wanna be like that?
Why, why, why you gotta dig in my business you fucking whore?
Stuck on yourself, you are
You take a dash for my cash it's that ass that I'm blasting!
Stuck on yourself, you whore
You take a dash for my cash it's that ass that I'm blasting!
You're bad luck, you're so, stuck!
Stuck, deep down in that hole again!
Stuck, got your brain on my green again!
Stuck, you're so, you're so
You're so stuck in your head don't even know!
Live on tape bitch
Don't fuck with us!
