<pre>
Use your vehicle of salvation my brothers, go buy a gun
And go give your gun to Jesus and say
"Jesus, you go kill the disciples of Satan
And you kill the nazis, Jesus."
Give me an amen
Amen!
Give me a hallelujah, brother
Hallelujah!
Feel the pain of sweet Jesus
Give me another amen
Amen!
Give me another
Amen!
You've got to kill the noise
You've got to kill the pollution of Satan
Brother, give me a hallelujah
Hallelujah!
Have you been healed?
Have you been saved?
Has it happened to you, my brother?
Thank the Lord
Praise the Lord
I love Jesus
I love Jesus
Kill the pollution!
Pollution!
</pre>
