Poop
Oh yeah!

Tell me why you came, tell me why you're here
Tell me why your voice is always ringing in my ear
So you wanna be the man hanging with my crew?
Who the hell let you through?
I see you're always at my shows, always with my bros
Always finding places where I think nobody goes
I can't seem to shake you from this
So now I'll have to break you from this!

Can't you just let me be, you leech?

Oh, get it straight!
And can't you take a hint? We thought you had a friend
It's such a shame that you're coming around again
Man, I'd really love to take you out like Chuck Norris
Instead I'd kick him with a vocal, slap him with a chorus
Man I really shouldn't have to beg
The big mistake was when your mom and daddy hit the bed
Oh, you seem to not get the picture
So I'll frame this script that'll grip ya!

Can't you just let me be, you leech?

Stop sticking around!
Stop sticking around!
Stop sticking around!
Leech!

Fool, stop sticking around!
