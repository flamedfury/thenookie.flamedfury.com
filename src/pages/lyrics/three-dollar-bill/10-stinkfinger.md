 I've seen your campus
I'm thinking I've been there before
You know something I live
In this pig pen, this filthy pig pit next door
Another stench of my aroma
Sticks that nose up in the air
Is that the excuse you use to ruin me?

I need to get you outta my way!
Pack them bags punk, get the fuck outta here!
I need to get you outta my way!
"Love thy neighbor!" Love my neighbor? Yeah right, right

Yo J drop that one down
Your existence means less now
That it probably ever has before
You've got your head up your ass
Out of your mouth comes nothing but shh
...should I listen? I absorb
You amuse me, idiot
All bent outta shape
'Cause I piss on your gate

I need to get you outta my way!
Pack them bags punk, get the fuck outta here!
I need to get you outta my way!
"Love thy neighbor!" Love my neighbor? Yeah right, right

And you don't stop and we won't stop, that's right
And you can't stop, this shit, it just won't stop
Let's take it to the curb if you can stand it
Put yourself in my position, man!
Let's take it to the curb if you can stand it
Put yourself in my position man!
Let's take it to the curb!
Put yourself in my position man!
Take it to the curb!
Put yourself in my position man!
Punk, how you wanna take it to the curb?
Ah, you wanna take it to the curb?
Ah put you, put you, ah
Put yourself in my position man!
And you don't
Freak, freak, freak and you don't stop
You got it! Stinky, stinky finger
And you don't and you don't
