 It's not my mind
It's not my mind
It's not my mind
It's not my mind
It's not my mind
It's not my mind
Yo J
Can I get a little bit?

Your veins flow with poison, please acknowledge my present
This precious gift I behold, you discard like trash
To dominate it's in your nature, you selfish brat
I can't believe you had me strung out over you like that

One minute you're sweet the next minute you're sour
I taste the envious predictions
Change with each hour, I've seen this before
You even decided to step into my little world

Strange things occurring, happening over and
Over and over again – habitual cruelty
You bark your orders with such a degrading dialect
I can't believe you had me strung out over you like that

One minute you're sweet the next minute you're sour
I taste the envious predictions
Change with each hour, I've seen this before
You even decided to step into my little world

Gonna funk it up
One minute you think you're all this
The next minute you think you're all that
But you're playing with a nova
Momma didn't show ya
How to take getting canned by the man when it's over?
I've been hunting you down
Waiting for the payback, you frown
Begging me for your mercy
I ain't down with the sympathy, you see?
And I'll always remember your tender love wiped me under the rug
Just so you could step on my spine – I'm gonna get mine!

I'm gonna get mine!
All this pain inflicted reminds me (I'm gonna get mine!)
All this time which was wasted behind me (I'm gonna get mine!)
Behind these walls of chain you'll find me (I'm gonna get mine!)
I'd like to re-arrange your face (I'm gonna get mine!)

(Please don't wake me)
I'm gonna get mine!
(Please don't wake me)
You're so sweet
You're so sweet
You're so sweet
I'm gonna get mine!
I'm gonna get mine!
I'm gonna get mine!
So stop, was wasted behind me
I'm gonna get mine!
Behind these walls of chain you'll find me
I'm gonna get mine!
I'm gonna get mine!
I'm gonna get mine!

You're always, you're always right
And I'm always wrong
That's why you love me so much
You're so sweet
I love you
You're so sweet
I love you
</pre>
