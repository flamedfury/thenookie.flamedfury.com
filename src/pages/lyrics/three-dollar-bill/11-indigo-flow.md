Yo, what up?
Got Christian and Dino in the house
Fear Factory action
We kick off this new joint here for all my homies

Separating the true breeds from my friends and my family
Had a vision with no bounds, now it's blowing up
Props to the field dog
With the vote to the campaign, gold records and champagne
Everlast for the tour on St. Patty's
Chino, man we had a blast with your Deftones
Rock them microphones daily
Props to the maestro, Ross you're an angel
Hey DJ, wanna play that song?
Lethal, we love you like a brother
Wanna take a trip to the flip side, Jordan?
Nothing more than I can say, see you walking hand in hand with the Prophet
Danny, you took us to that fat man
Harry Tiyler props for the tour and introduction
We're coming from the town of the unknown
Jacksonville's on the map

Look us up, raising eyebrows with the Jaguars, kid
Better watch out
Line 'em up, Cheetah
Yo Richard, Rob and Chuck, hook it up

When I walk out on stage, all headaches go away
Got the back from the sickest road crew
Chris and Bobby for sticking to it
Sugar Ray taught me life was all about drinking
Bow Wow, yippee yo yippee yay
To the funk, Doobie, thanks for showing up
All my brothers in Ko–Øn I love you
Dad and Momma, I'm coming home

What up to my girl Sage, Shaun, Teddy Swoes
Indigo Ranch alive with the vibe
Grundig, Danny at The Milk Bar, Terry Parker you know what's up
Dialed into The Planet and God, I love you!
