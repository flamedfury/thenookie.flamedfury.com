<pre>
I'm so frustrated
Some things are making me so sick inside
Aw, go with your heart, go with your heart
Yeah right
Quit tugging me
Aw, I'm just not good enough for you
Let's change
Let's be something we're not
Let's be something everybody else is
Ah so much built up inside
It's fucking ridiculous
I don't know if I should freak the fuck out on you
Or just sit back and laugh
You want more
You don't have anything
Me, me, I have everything
Yeah I have everything
What more could I ask for?
Nothing at all

Why did it have to be this way at the end?
Why did it have to be this way at the end?
