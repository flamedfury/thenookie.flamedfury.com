 Alright, partner, keep on rollin', baby, you know what time it is
(Ladies and gentlemen!)
(Throw your hands up)
(Throw your, your hands up)
(Throw your, throw, throw your)
(Throw your, your, your hands, your, your hands up)
(Throw your hands up)
Chocolate Starfish, wanna keep on rollin', baby!
(Your hands up)
(Throw, your hands up)
(Throw your hands up)
(Throw your hands up)

I move in, now move out, hands up, now hands down!
Back up, back up, tell me what you're gonna do now!
Breathe in, now breathe out, hands up, now hands down!
Back up, back up, tell me what you're gonna do now!
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (What?)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Come on!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Yeah)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'

Now I know y'all be lovin' this shit right here
L.I.M.P. Bizkit is right here
People in the house put them hands in the air
'Cause if you don't care, then we don't care (yeah)
One, two, three times, two to the six
Jonesin' your fix of that Limp Bizkit mix
So where the fuck you at, punk?
Shut the fuck up and back the fuck up while we fuck this track up

(Throw your hands up)
(Throw, your hands up)
(Throw, throw your hands up)
(Throw your hands up)
(Throw your hands up)

I move in, now move out, hands up, now hands down!
Back up, back up, tell me what you're gonna do now!
Breathe in, now breathe out, hands up, now hands down!
Back up, back up, tell me what you're gonna do now!
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (What?)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Come on!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Yeah)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'

You wanna mess with Limp Bizkit? (Yeah)
You can't mess with Limp Bizkit (Why?)
Because we get it on (When?)
Everyday and every night (Oh)
And this platinum thing right here (Aha?)
Yo, we're doin' it all the time (What?)
So you better get some better beats and, ah
Get some better rhymes (Duh!)
We got the gang set, so don't complain yet
Twenty-four-seven, never beggin' for a rain check
Old school soldiers blastin' out the hot shit
That rock shit, puttin' bounce in the mosh pit

(Throw your hands up)
(Throw, your hands up)
(Throw, throw your hands up)
(Throw your hands up)
(Throw your hands up)

I move in, now move out, hands up, now hands down!
Back up, back up, tell me what you're gonna do now!
Breathe in, now breathe out, hands up, now hands down!
Back up, back up, tell me what you're gonna do now!
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (What?)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Come on!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Yeah)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'

Hey, ladies (Where you at?), hey, fellas (Where you at?)
And the people that don't give a fuck (Where you at?)
All the lovers (Where you at?), all the haters (Where you at?)
And all the people that call themselves players (Where you at?)
Hot mamas (Where you at?), pimp daddies (Where you at?)
And the people rollin' up in caddies (Where you at?)
Hey, rockers (Where you at?), hip-hoppers (Where you at?)
And everybody all around the world

Move in, now move out, hands up, now hands down!
Back up, back up, tell me what you're gonna do now!
Breathe in, now breathe out, hands up, now hands down!
Back up, back up, tell me what you're gonna do now!
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (What?)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Come on!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Yeah)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Move in, now move out, hands up, now hands down!
Back up, back up, tell me what you're gonna do now!
Breathe in, now breathe out, hands up, now hands down!
Back up, back up, tell me what you're gonna do now!
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (What?)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Come on!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Yeah)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
